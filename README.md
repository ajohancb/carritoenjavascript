# Welcome to the JavaScript Shopping Cart project!

This project is a simple shopping cart application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to add and remove items from their cart.

To use the shopping cart, simply add items to your cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button next to the item you want to purchase. You can view the items in your cart by clicking the "Cart" button. From there, you can remove items from your cart.

Please note that the shopping cart does not actually do anything more. It is a simulation only.

The project is open source and available on GitHub. Feel free to clone or download the code and use it as a starting point for your own projects.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub.

Thank you for using the JavaScript Shopping Cart!
